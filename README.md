This is a module for use in conjunction with [Cypher System for Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem/) and the [CSRD Compendium](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem-compendium/). The Cypher System Community Module expands the Cypher System with content generated by the community.

## Contents

The Cypher System Community Content module comes with various compendium packs, which include the following content:

- Meeples, which are quick, pre-made standard NPCs from levels 1 through 10 in various colors. Use them when you need a quick standard NPC on a scene.
- Example actors that highlight varios features of the Cypher System with short explanations of these features in the actor’s description tab.
- Pre-made scenes for with various themes. One includes a space combat tracker, as explained in the Science Fiction Rulebook in the CSRD Compendium.
- A Technofantasy Ruleset, which serves as an example on how to create your own rulesets using just the content from the CSRD Compendium. This is a great start for any Numenera game.

## Contributing
