This is a module for use in conjunction with the [Cypher System game system for Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem/). The Cypher System Community Module expands the Cypher System game system with content generated by the community.

## Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is to clone this repository locally, make the changes you want, and create a pull request to the develop branch. For support, visit the [Cypher FVTT Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/C5zGgtyhwa).

The content in this module must adhere to the Fan Use Policy, so only game terms and associated numerical values from MCG published books can be used. All items from published books should come with page references, which turn into clickable links if the corresponding PDF is created as a journal entry within Foundry using [PDFoundry](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pdfoundry/).

## Support and Community

The [Cypher FVTT Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/C5zGgtyhwa) is where the development of the system and this module is coordinated and their futures discussed, but anyone is welcome to join and share best practices, ask questions on how to use the system, and share self-created resources for your games.

You can also reach me on the [official Foundry Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) or via Discord DM: @mrkwnzl#7407.
