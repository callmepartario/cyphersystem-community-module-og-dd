This PC has been created for an urban fantasy setting using the CSRD Compendium. </p><h2>Showcase: Spells</h2><p>The abilities that would qualify as magic are sorted as spells using the @UUID[Compendium.cyphersystem-compendium.cypher-journals.k9exUQdtIwtKwqCc.JournalEntryPage.5tBpQHxLFK0uSx7O#optional-rule:-spellcasting]{Optional Rule: Spellcasting}. This does two things: Firstly, it sorts these abilities under their own heading, and secondly, it enables a new button to pay a recovery roll for an unprepared spell’s usage. The rules allow for a number of prepared spells, which don’t require the expenditure of a recovery roll. I archive the spells that are currently not prepared. I also noted down which tier the prepared spells are in the notes tab because you can only switch the currently prepared spell with a spell of the same tier. To sort an ability under the spell header, go to the item sheet’s setting tab and select “Spells” for sorting.</p><h3>Other features used</h3><ul><li><p>Lasting/permanent

This PC has been created for The Strange using the CSRD Compendium. </span></p><h2>Feature Showcase: Recursions</h2><p>Being a character for The Strange, Alexina has game mode set to “The Strange,” which enables the recursion tab. There, three recursions are listed:</p><ul><li><p>Earth</p></li><li><p>Ardeyn</p></li><li><p>Ruk</p></li></ul><p>Each recursion has its own focus, set in the recursion item. If the recursion is enabled, all items that have the corresponding recursion tag (e.g. <code>@Earth</code>) in its description is enabled. All items that have a different recursion tag in their description are being archived. The recursion tags have been marked as secret in the editor, which allows for the tag to be revealed or hidden on the character sheet. In this case, so that all tags are more obvious, they are set to be revealed.</p><p>Since there are three different recursions, the archive has been hidden, so that only the current items are listed on the sheet.</p><p>On Ardeyn, Alexina has the Enhanced Might ability, which grants her 3 additional Might points, but only on Ardeyn. For that, the modifier of her Might stat is set on the Ardeyn recursion item. This automatically changes her stat and edge values accordingly.</p><p>For example, if Alexina translates from Earth to Ardeyn, her medium handgun and knife are being archived and her crossbow and dagger are enabled. The same happens for all her other equipment, skills, and abilities. At the same time, her Might pool increases from 12 to
